## What this bundle is not …

## Background
When I was in school, I used to be a python guy. I used python to quickly prototype algos and programs in class. 
I was using Django for all my web needs, and happened to love how the Django admin was handling things.

Now that I mostly work in PHP, I kind of miss this simplicity, so I fiddled a bit that is the result. 
Keep in mind that this is **not** version *1.0 material*, so I wouldn't use it on a real project yet.

## What it does
- Add CRUD actions for an entity in 5 lines of YAML
- Row and multi-row actions, search, filters and pagination
- Clean and simple UI

## What it does not
- Handle entity relations
- Dashboard widgets
- Security/Authentication
- Solve world hunger
